print("Strength and determination had won him fame,For he won his battles with his muscle and his drive.Their gilded pride he would shatter and maim,For combat was his talent, and a desire to live.His furious power seemed to know no bounds,As his rage struck the earth, awakening a mole.Yet no ears could hear the sounds,Of his feathery footsteps as he strollNeither heel nor Delilah did this hero possess,Unless his oversize ventricles were dissected.Yet all his sinews were powered by the weakness,And his Herculean strength remained pure, uninfected.Only a Saiyan with a soul pure and true,Can turn his hair to the goldest hue.")
